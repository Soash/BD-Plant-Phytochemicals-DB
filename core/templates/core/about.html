          The Bangladeshi Medicinal Plant Phytochemicals Database (BMPPD) is a research-focused digital resource
          developed to support the systematic study of medicinal plants and their phytochemical constituents in
          Bangladesh. It represents the first curated phytochemical database of Bangladeshi medicinal plants,
          created through two years of dedicated data collection, validation, and organisation.
        </p>

        <p class="small text-dark mb-3">
          BMPPD provides a centralised, structured, and searchable platform containing information on more than
          700 medicinal plants and over 120,000 phytochemical compounds, curated from peer-reviewed scientific
          literature. The database is designed to assist researchers, students, and pharmaceutical scientists in
          natural product research, phytochemistry, and early-stage drug discovery.
